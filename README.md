# DesignPattern-2

Platform : XCode10

Language: Swift 4.2


1. Composite Pattern

        Composite pattern is a partitioning design pattern and describes a group of objects
        that is treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. 
        The intent of a composite is to “compose” objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

2. Decorator Pattern

        The Decorator pattern dynamically adds behaviors and responsibilities to an object without modifying its code. 
        It's an alternative to subclassing where you modify a class's behavior by wrapping it with another object. 
        In Swift there are two very common implementations of this pattern: Extensions and Delegation.
